# pug4j - a pug implementation written in Java
pug4j's intention is to be able to process pug templates in Java without the need of a JavaScript environment, while being **fully compatible** with the original pug syntax.

pug4j was formerly known as jade4j. Because of the naming change of the javascript version and the alignment to the featureset of pug.js (https://pugjs.org/) we decided to switch the name.

With the addition of a new [GraalJsExpressionHandler](#graalvm) your code can be more compatible to the js version than before.

## Example

index.pug

```
doctype html
html
  head
    title= pageName
  body
    ol#books
      for book in books
        if book.available
          li #{book.name} for #{book.price} €
```

Java model

```java
List<Book> books = new ArrayList<Book>();
books.add(new Book("The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", 5.70, true));
books.add(new Book("Life, the Universe and Everything", 5.60, false));
books.add(new Book("The Restaurant at the End of the Universe", 5.40, true));

Map<String, Object> model = new HashMap<String, Object>();
model.put("books", books);
model.put("pageName", "My Bookshelf");
```

Running the above code through `String html = Pug4J.render("./index.pug", model)` will result in the following output:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Bookshelf</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <ol id="books">
      <li>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for 5,70 €</li>
      <li>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe for 5,40 €</li>
    </ol>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Syntax

See also the original [https://github.com/pugjs/pug#syntax](https://github.com/pugjs/pug#syntax).

## Usage

### via Maven

Just add following dependency definitions to your `pom.xml`.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>de.neuland-bfi</groupId>
  <artifactId>pug4j</artifactId>
  <version>2.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Build it yourself

Clone this repository ...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neuland/pug4j.git
```

... build it using `maven` ...

```bash
cd pug4j
mvn install
```

... and use the `pug4j-2.x.x.jar` located in your target directory.

<a name="simple-api"></a>
## Simple static API

Parsing template and generating template in one step.

```java
String html = Pug4J.render("./index.pug", model);
```

If you use this in production you would probably do the template parsing only once per template and call the render method with different models.

```java
PugTemplate template = Pug4J.getTemplate("./index.pug");
String html = Pug4J.render(template, model);
```

Streaming output using a `java.io.Writer`

```java
Pug4J.render(template, model, writer);
```

<a name="api"></a>
## Full API

If you need more control you can instantiate a `PugConfiguration` object.
Pug4J needs a Base path, so that it can determine the parent path. In the simple static API the basePath is empty.
To configure a basePath. You need to use the FileTemplateLoader or ClassPathTemplateLoader and set setBase("").
Example for template location: /root/dir/base/path/index.pug

```java
FileTemplateLoader fileLoader = new FileTemplateLoader("/root/dir/");
fileLoader.setBase("base/path");

PugConfiguration config = new PugConfiguration();
config.setTemplateLoader(fileLoader);

PugTemplate template = config.getTemplate("/index");

Map<String, Object> model = new HashMap<String, Object>();
model.put("company", "neuland");

config.renderTemplate(template, model);
```
Pug is now allowed to read all files below /root/dir/ but not in / and /root.

<a name="api-caching"></a>
### Caching

The `PugConfiguration` handles template caching for you. If you request the same unmodified template twice you'll get the same instance and avoid unnecessary parsing.

```java
PugTemplate t1 = config.getTemplate("index.pug");
PugTemplate t2 = config.getTemplate("index.pug");
t1.equals(t2) // true
```

You can clear the template and expression cache by calling the following:

```java
config.clearCache();
```

For development mode, you can also disable caching completely:

```java
config.setCaching(false);
```

<a name="api-output"></a>
### Output Formatting

By default, Pug4J produces compressed HTML without unneeded whitespace. You can change this behaviour by enabling PrettyPrint:

```java
config.setPrettyPrint(true);
```

Pug detects if it has to generate (X)HTML or XML code by your specified [doctype](https://github.com/pugjs/pug#syntax).

If you are rendering partial templates that don't include a doctype pug4j generates HTML code. You can also set the `mode` manually:

```
config.setMode(Pug4J.Mode.HTML);   // <input checked>
config.setMode(Pug4J.Mode.XHTML);  // <input checked="true" />
config.setMode(Pug4J.Mode.XML);    // <input checked="true"></input>
```

<a name="api-filters"></a>
### Filters

Filters allow embedding content like `markdown` into your pug template:

    :markdown
      # headline
      hello **world**

will generate

    <h1>headline</h1>
    <p>hello <strong>world</strong></p>

pug4j comes with a `plain` and `cdata` filter. `plain` takes your input to pass it directly through, `cdata` wraps your content in `<![CDATA[...]]>`. You can add your custom filters to your configuration.

    config.setFilter("markdown", new MarkdownFilter());

To implement your own filter, you have to implement the `Filter` Interface. If your filter doesn't use any data from the model you can inherit from the abstract `CachingFilter` and also get caching for free. See the [neuland/jade4j-coffeescript-filter](https://github.com/neuland/jade4j-coffeescript-filter) project as an example.

<a name="api-helpers"></a>
### Helpers

If you need to call custom java functions the easiest way is to create helper classes and put an instance into the model.

```java
public class MathHelper {
    public long round(double number) {
        return Math.round(number);
    }
}
```

```java
model.put("math", new MathHelper());
```

Note: Helpers don't have their own namespace, so you have to be careful not to overwrite them with other variables.

```
p= math.round(1.44)
```

<a name="api-model-defaults"></a>
### Model Defaults

If you are using multiple templates you might have the need for a set of default objects that are available in all templates.

```java
Map<String, Object> defaults = new HashMap<String, Object>();
defaults.put("city", "Bremen");
defaults.put("country", "Germany");
defaults.put("url", new MyUrlHelper());
config.setSharedVariables(defaults);
```

<a name="api-template-loader"></a>
### Template Loader

By default, pug4j searches for template files in your work directory. By specifying your own `FileTemplateLoader`, you can alter that behavior. You can also implement the `TemplateLoader` interface to create your own.

```java
TemplateLoader loader = new FileTemplateLoader("/templates/", "UTF-8"); //Defines the path under which all templates are found. You can't include templates from parent directory "/"
loader.setBase("my-maintemplates/"); //the folder where all files starting with "/" are found. This where your main templates are.
config.setTemplateLoader(loader);
```
* '/index' points to '/templates/my-maintemplates/index.pug'
* 'index' points to '/templates/index.pug'

There is also a `ClasspathTemplateLoader` and `ReaderTemplateLoader`.

<a name="expressions"></a>
## Expressions

The original pug implementation uses JavaScript for expression handling in `if`, `unless`, `for`, `case` commands, like this

    - var book = {"price": 4.99, "title": "The Book"}
    if book.price < 5.50 && !book.soldOut
      p.sale special offer: #{book.title}

    each author in ["artur", "stefan", "michael","christoph"]
      h2= author

### Jexl Expressionhandler (default)
Pug4j uses [JEXL](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/) for parsing and executing these expressions.
JEXL syntax and behavior is very similar to ECMAScript/JavaScript and so closer to the original pug.js implementation. JEXL runs also much faster than GraalVM.
If your template don't relies too much on Javascript-Logic and gets almost everything from the model, this is a good choice.

We are using a slightly modified JEXL version which to have better control of the exception handling. JEXL now runs in a semi-strict mode, where non existing values and properties silently evaluate to `null`/`false` where as invalid method calls lead to a `PugCompilerException`.
<a name="reserved-words"></a>
#### Reserved Words

JEXL comes with the three builtin functions `new`, `size` and `empty`. For properties with this name the `.` notation does not work, but you can access them with `[]`.

```
- var book = {size: 540}
book.size // does not work
book["size"] // works
```

You can read more about this in the [JEXL documentation](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/reference/syntax.html#Language_Elements).

<a name="graalvm"></a>
### GraalVM Expressionhandler (NEW! since 2.0.0)
If you want to use pure javascript expression handling, you can try out the new GraalJS Expression Handler. It supports native javascript expressions but is slower than the Jexl Expression Handler. You can configure it like this:

```java
PugConfiguration config = new PugConfiguration();

config.setExpressionHandler(new GraalJsExpressionHandler())
```


<a name="framework-integrations"></a>
## Framework Integrations
- [neuland/spring-pug4j](https://github.com/neuland/spring-pug4j) pug4j spring integration.
- [vertx-web](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_jade_template_engine) jade4j for [Vert.X](http://vertx.io/)

<a name="breaking-changes-2"></a>
## Breaking Changes in 2.0.0
- Classes are renamed to pug4j.
- Default file extension is now .pug
- Compiler Level has been raised to Java 8+
- Syntax has been adapted to the most current pug version. (2.0.4)
- Filter interface changed
- Interpolations not supported in attributes and filters anymore. It now behaves the same way as in pug.js.

<a name="breaking-changes-1"></a>
### Breaking Changes in 1.3.1
- Fixed a mayor scoping bug in loops. Use this version and not 1.3.0

### Breaking Changes in 1.3.0
- setBasePath has been removed from JadeConfiguration. Set folderPath on FileTemplateLoader instead.
- Scoping of variables in loops changed, so its more in line with jade. This could break your template.

### Breaking Changes in 1.2.0
- Breaking change in filter interface: if you use filters outside of the project, they need to be adapted to new interface

### Breaking Changes in 1.0.0
In Version 1.0.0 we added a lot of features of JadeJs 1.11. There are also some Breaking Changes:
- Instead of 'id = 5' you must use '- var id = 5'
- Instead of 'h1(attributes, class = "test")' you must use 'h1(class= "test")&attributes(attributes)'
- Instead of '!!! 5' you must use 'doctype html'
- Jade Syntax for Conditional Comments is not supported anymore
